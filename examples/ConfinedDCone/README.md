This is an example file for a lammps dcone. One note, this has been built to
run as quickly as possible, so beware that it is not totally quasi-static. If
you want a more quasi-static dcone, increase the simtime (which increases the
physical time over which this experiment is performed), but beware, that the
time that the simulation takes to run is proportional to this experimental time
