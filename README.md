# LAMMPSStructures

In this repository I have a couple of different examples of how we make and use elastic structures in LAMMPS. I will split this up into two categories of structures:

 - 1d structures, which are "grains" or "particles" arranged in a line to form an elastic beam
 - 2d structures, which are particles arranged in a triangular lattice to form an elastic sheet

In each of these directories I will have some verification (probably in COMSOL, or with experiments from our lab) for some different kind of structures, videos of some of our simulations and some heavily commented example files. In this main folder I also have a PDF of the derivation of all of the interatomic forces -- PairPotentialDerivations.pdf. Hopefully there is enough information here that you could take the code and modify it to simulate your own situation :)
