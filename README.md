# LAMMPSStructures

In this repository I have a couple of different examples of how we make and use elastic structures in LAMMPS. I will split this up into two categories of structures:

 - 1d structures, which are "grains" or "particles" arranged in a line to form an elastic beam
 - 2d structures, which are particles arranged in a triangular lattice to form an elastic sheet

In each of these directories I will have pdfs of the derivations of the interatomic forces, that is, the forces that hold the particles together to ensure that their bulk behavior matches what we would expect for elastic bodies. I will also have some verification (probably in COMSOL) for both 1d and 2d structures, and finally, I will have some directories which contain examples of how we used these structures, hopefully commented enough so that you could take the code and modify it to simulate your own situation :)
